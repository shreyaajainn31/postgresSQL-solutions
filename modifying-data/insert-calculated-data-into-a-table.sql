Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else:
Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.
'''
insert into cd.facilities
    (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)
    select (select max(facid) from cd.facilities)+1, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800;
